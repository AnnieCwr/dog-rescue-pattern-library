The buttons used mostly the company's primary color to highlight and make the information stands out. Each buttons has a specific purpose:

- "Visit our blog" will bring users to our company's blog. It would be on a light background so a dark primary colour would be good for it.
- "Go to application" will be under animal's description page, it would be appear on a dark background so a neutral light color would pops it out.
- "APPLY NOW" is the main button that is going to appear under the banner section where there is an image background, its font size and font weight are increased so that it is more notable on on the scree. The transparent background also wouldn't make the banner be too busy.
- "Submit" is used at form where there is a white background, it is good to use our primary colours because it would make the button standout and make the whole website design look more uniformed.
- "Discover Your Happy Tail" will possibly appear in under the banner section too, it is an alternative of "APPLY NOW".
