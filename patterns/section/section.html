      <h2> Dog of the week: Abbey</h2>
      <p class="micro">I had the great pleasure of spending 2.5 hours in the car with Abi when I transported her from her temporary foster mom to her long-term foster mom. We met in a parking lot, half asleep, at 6am and as soon as I said her name she ran over and jumped into my arms.  She rode the entire way on my lap and between naps and loads of kisses (whether I wanted them or not! lol), we became fast friends.</p>
