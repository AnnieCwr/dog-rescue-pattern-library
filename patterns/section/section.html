      <h2> Dog of the week: Abbey</h2>
      <p class="micro">I had the great pleasure of spending 2.5 hours in the car with Abi when I transported her from her temporary foster mom to her long-term foster mom. We met in a parking lot, half asleep, at 6am and as soon as I said her name she ran over and jumped into my arms. She rode the entire way on my lap and between naps and loads of kisses (whether I wanted them or not! lol), we became fast friends.</p>

      <h3>Ricky Adopted!</h3>
      <p class="micro">Everyday I am thankful for having found my sweet little boy, Ricky. I adopted him September 21, 2012. He has so much love to give and does not hesitate to seek affection throughout the day and evening. He absolutely loves his walks. When asked if he wants to go for a car ride, he is beside himself in excitement. He wants to be a part of everything we do. Thank you again Loyal Rescue. You are all amazing. Thank you again to Janet, who fostered Ricky.</p>
